Suspenion Design Aid 
Created by Timm Von Derau

Directions
 - Check the FSAE specific design restrictions (wheel base, track, etc) and be 
 sure that the design code reflects those.
 - Modify the global variables only. 90% of them are in the "SuspensionCalcs.m"
 file. The rest are in their respective function M files.
 - Open Matlab. Navigate to the folder holding the files. ALL FILES MUST BE
 TOGETHER IN THE FOLDER. Type "run suspensionCalcs.m" (Caps matters)
 - Profit. 
 
 Equations come from the book "Race Car Design" by Derek Seward. The equations
 are not derived and in the "solved" form (IE, the moments solved for FEA are
 presented as [Force interested in] = [rest of the equation]. There is no need
 to solve for anything. They can easily be deconstructed though to learn how 
 they came about. 
 
 I will likely improve on this in the coming months. There are more suspension 
 parameters to work with, and I hate excel and am too lazy for hand calcs 
 unless they are simple. I want to add parts from Milken's book, along with 
 more from Seward's. Tune to win will likely be included as well when able.
 
 Watch this space.
 
 Vroom Vroom. 
 
 
 Good luck,
